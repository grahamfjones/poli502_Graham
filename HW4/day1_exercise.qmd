## Task 1


#Name has been modified.


## Task 2. The following calculations have been performed.


```{r}
# 2-1: Multiply 4 by 30 plus 6, and then raise the answer to the power of 0.5
(4 * (30 +6)) ^ 0.5 # a sample answer is here
```

```{r}
(4 * 30 + 6) ^ 0.5
```


### 2-2: Multiply 4 by 30, then add 6 and then raise the answer to the power of 0.5 

((4 * 30) + 6) ^ 0.5

Note that 2-1 and 2-2 should give you DIFFERENT answers, because these are different operations. 




## Task 3. Working with objects 

### 3-1: Create an object called "X1" which is the number 73 

X1 <- 73

### 3-2: Create another object called "X2" which is the answer to the sum 99 + 38

X2 <- (99 + 38)

### 3-3: Multiply X1 and X2 together and store the answer as another object called "X3"

X3 <- (X1 * X2)

### 3-4: Subtract 1 from X3, and then raise the answer to the power of 0.25

(X3 - 1)^0.25



## Task 4. Calculation using objects

Redo the calculation in 2-1 (Multiply 4 by 30 plus 6, and then raise the answer to the power of 0.5), but this time do so by creating objects. 
Take the following steps:


### 4-1: Create an object called part.1 that is equal to "30 plus 6"

part.1 <- (30 + 6)

### 4-2: Create an object called part.2 that is equal to 4 times part.1

part.2 <- (4 * part.1)

### 4-3: Raise part.2 to the power of 0.5

part.2 ^ 0.5

The numerical answer you get here should be the same as your answer for 2.1


## Task 5. Detecting R data types 

### 5-1 Create a character vector and show that it is character. 

class(c("Hello Graham"))

### 5-2 Create a numeric vector and coerce it to a factor vector. 

class(as.factor(c(1, 2, 3)))



## Task 6. Testing NA 

### 6-1 Create a numeric vector with NA 

c(1, 2, 3, NA)

### 6-2 Show me where the NA is located in the vector (using the which() function)

which(is.na(c(1, 2, 3, NA)))

### 6-1 Create a numeric vector with NaN  

c(1, 2, 3, NaN)

### 6-2 Show me where the NaN  is located in the vector (using the which() function)

which(is.nan(c(1, 2, 3, NaN)))
